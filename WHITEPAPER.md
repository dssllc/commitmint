## Introduction ‚Äì briefly define the topic of the white paper

_Commitmint_ is a smart contract platform built for relationships. Our smart contracts are NFTs (Non-fungible tokens) built for two to establish permanent tokens of commitment, friendship and love. It takes two to "mint" (create) a toke and two to "burn" (reject) a token, with varying terms for each activity.

### Tokens of Friendship ü§ù

These are casual relationships with easy terms. Just like a _friend request_, a user creates a _Token of Friendship_ request for the wallet address of a friend, and the friend can accept the request to "mint" (create) thje token and make the friendship official.

Either friend can "burn" reject the friendship token.

### Tokens of Love ‚ù§Ô∏è

These are permanent relationships with meaningful terms. More like a marriage proposal, this token signifies a committed, loving relationship that can not be easily broken.

A user creates a _Token of Love_ request for the wallet address of their loved one, but it also carries a commitment of a valuable resource, such as an NFT or amount of cryptocurrency. Both parties must commit to the same resource to mint the token. Resources can be assigned to the NFT, or burned, to mint the token.

The _Token of Love_ request also has the terms to burn the token, such as splitting the resources, burning resources, contributing resources. This is not the terms of what would cause a burn, only the terms to complete the token burn.

## Challenge ‚Äì describe the reader‚Äôs pain points

We believe that in life relationships matter most. Our friends and loved ones form us all, and some of our most cherished things are the memories, the photos, the places and the things that we share with them.

The power of friendship alone has transformed us all in the world of social media. The social platforms have become the basis of expressing our relationships and connecting with our friends and family. But those systems are closed, and toxic, and riddled with mistrust.

People are ready for a new, trustless, immutable means of expressing our relationships and strengthening our bonds. The blockchain technology we have developed gives us the means to establish permanent, consensual relationships on our own terms. NFTs (Non-fungible tokens) have demonstrated the future of ownership and membership, and now we have NFTs to express our commitment to others without borders, censorship or discrimination.
