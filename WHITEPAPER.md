## Introduction ‚Äì briefly define the topic of the white paper

We believe that in life relationships matter most. Our friends and loved ones form us all, and some of our most cherished things are the memories, the photos, the places and the things that we share with them.

_Commitmint_ is a smart contract platform built for relationships. Our smart contracts are NFTs (Non-fungible tokens) built for two to establish permanent tokens of commitment, friendship and love. It takes two to ‚Äúmint‚Äù (create) a toke and two to ‚Äúburn‚Äù (destroy) a token, with varying terms for each activity.

## Challenge ‚Äì describe the reader‚Äôs pain points

The power of friendship alone has transformed us all in the world of social media. The social platforms have become the basis of expressing our relationships and connecting with our friends and family. But those systems are closed, and toxic, and riddled with mistrust.

People are ready for a new, trustless, immutable means of expressing our relationships and strengthening our bonds. The blockchain technology we have developed gives us the means to establish permanent, consensual relationships on our own terms. NFTs (Non-fungible tokens) have demonstrated the future of ownership and membership, and now we have NFTs to express our commitment to others without borders, censorship or discrimination.
