## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```

## Local dev setup

1. Install application
   * Open a terminal, clone repo, open the directory and run `yarn install`
2. Start the front end
   * Open another terminal in the same directory and run `yarn start`
3. Start the local blockchain node
   * Open another terminal in the same directory and run `npx hardhat node`
4. Deploy the contracts to the local node
   * Open another terminal in the same directory and run `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-tokens.js --network localhost`
5. Update the contract address constants
   * Update addresses in `src/constants.js` with addresses from step 4

### Dev Notes

1. Be sure to setup the localhost custom RPC in metamask
   * Name: Localhost 8545
   * New RPC URL: http://localhost:8545
   * Chain ID: 1337
   * Currency Symbol: ETH
2. Reset the Metamask account each time the chain is restarted
  * The nonce resets with the chain and metamask gets out of sync
  * MetaMask > Settings > Advanced > Reset Account
     * Do this for each account/wallet
